## GoalIT '24 ðŸ”¥

### Make or break your year with GoalIT ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ¯
<br/>

### Why GoalIT?
Every year I come up with resolutions but sadly I don't keep track of them nor do I end up completing them. This year I realised to be mindful about how I approach my life in general. Hence, made a little something
to track my goals for the year 2024!

This project is intended to understand Django REST Framework, Redux and how to connect it with my React App.
