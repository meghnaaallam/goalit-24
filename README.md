### Django REST APIs

- Making REST APIs with Django:

1. Install Python & Django Rest Framework
2. Setup Django models - holds the data
3. Set up serializers - converts the object into JSON Format
4. Set up views - accepts the request, they are like controllers
5. Set up URLs - create different endpoints for REST API

settings.py - used to edit/delete all the settings required for the server
